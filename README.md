There are tons of operations that can be made into your firebase database using JSON rules, you can potentially control what your user can change, do or access from your database.

Compilation of the common security rules for Firebase that are often used by people in their projects.

There are numerous rules people use in their projects, this is collection of those which have been used in my projects or in some other.

Currently there are JSON codes for following kind of behavior:

>**No security**

>**Full security**

>**Only Authenticated users can write**

>**Users can only access their own data**

>**Validates user is moderator from different database location**

>**Validates string datatype and length range**

>**Checks presense of child attributes**

>**Validates timestamp is not a future value**

>**Prevents Delete or Update**

>**Prevents only Delete**

>**Prevents only Update**

>**Prevents Create and Delete**

>**Allows update but no push (no new child created)**
